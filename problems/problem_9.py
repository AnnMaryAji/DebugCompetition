    """
    Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's 
    anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

    Examples:
    Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
    Output: [0,6]
    Explanation:
    The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
    The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

    Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
    Output: [0,1,2]
    Explanation:
    The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
    The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
    The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
