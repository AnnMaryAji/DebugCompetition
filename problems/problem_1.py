    """
    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Examples:
    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
